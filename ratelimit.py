"""Daily caps on AI calls — protects the bot's Groq quota from spam.

Why this exists: anyone who can reach the bot (a group member, or any
Telegram user via DM) can trigger an AI call, and every call spends the
owner's Groq tokens. These caps bound how much any one user — or one
busy group — can spend in a day.

Rules (owner decision 2026-10-25, tightened the same day: "two
questions per day to start, four then six"):
- Per user per UTC day: rank 0 (starting) = 2 AI calls, rank 1 = 4,
  rank 2 = 6. Rank is earned by chatting on distinct days, so the
  allowance grows with time in the community.
- Per chat per UTC day: rank 0 = 10, rank 1 = 20, rank 2 = 30.
- "Day" is the UTC calendar day — the same reset as the daily token
  pot (budget.py) and Groq's own quota: counters reset at midnight UTC.
- The owner (OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID) is exempt.
- In-memory only: a redeploy resets the counters, which is fine for
  rate limiting and matches this bot's ephemeral design.
- A blocked call consumes nothing and is never recorded.
