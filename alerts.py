"""Owner alert throttling for the Garuda Assistant Bot (2026-10-25).

When something goes wrong inside the bot, the owner gets a DM — but
a repeating failure (a background job erroring every minute) must
not turn into alert spam. Rules:
- the same kind of problem alerts at most once per hour;
- total alerts are capped per rolling hour;
- record() is only called for an alert that will actually be sent,
  so suppressed problems stay suppressed until their window passes.
Pure and time-injected, so it's unit-testable.
